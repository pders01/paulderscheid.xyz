# Arcify Your Brave Browser

After reading that [The Browser Company](https://thebrowser.company/) is now focusing on something they can actually monetize, I started looking for alternatives again. Mainly to switch things up a little, but also to avoid becoming overly reliant on a proprietary browser (not that I have much against proprietary software). I checked out [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/) (which is awesome), but I still prefer a Chromium base, so I installed [Brave](https://brave.com/) againâ€”my next favorite project in this space.

## Prerequisite: Install the Nightly Release (Beta will also work, I assume)

To ensure access to all experimental features, **make sure you have the nightly release installed.**

## Enabling Vertical Tabs

Brave now supports _vertical_ tabs. This can be enabled by opening the context menu on the tab bar and selecting the vertical tab option. Great for organization!

## Enabling Split Tabs and Tab Groups

### Step 1: Access Brave Flags

1. Go to `brave://flags` in your browser.

### Step 2: Enable Split View

1. Search for and enable the flag _"Enable split view"_.
    - This feature allows for split tabs! While not as refined as in Arc, it's a promising start.

### Step 3: Enable Tab Grouping Features

1. Search for _"tab group"_.
2. Enable all related experiments (if you want). These include:
    - Tab Groups Save and Sync V2
    - Tab Group Sync Service Desktop Migration
    - Tab Groups Save UI Update
    - Tab Organization
    - Multi Tab Organization
    - Tab Reorganization
    - Tab Reorganization Divider

By enabling these features, you'll gain access to a sidebar that somewhat resembles the experience offered by Arc.

## Additional Tip: Shortcut for Searching Persistent Tabs

One of the cool features enabled through these configurations is the shortcut to search your (now persistent) tabs using `Meta + Shift + a`. This is something that the Arc team should've leveraged, as it's incredibly useful when not cramped into the global command palette.

I still use Arc on my private Mac and am very thankful to the team for pushing browser UX forward again in a meaningful way.
