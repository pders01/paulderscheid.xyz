# vscode + perlnavigator + koha-testing-docker

To get this working, here's what we'll need
* vscode w/
  * Microsoft's [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension
  * bscan's [perlnavigator](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bscan.perlnavigator) extension
  * Optionally: Microsoft's [docker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-azuretools.vscode-docker) extension
* koha-testing-docker
* koha

Got koha-testing-docker already up and running? Great!
If not, follow the [docs](https://gitlab.com/koha-community/koha-testing-docker#user-content-koha-testing-docker-aka-ktd).

# Using the dev containers extension

It's actually super straightforward.

## The clicky way

1. Open VSCode
2. Open the dev containers tab 
3. Right click the `koha-koha-1` container
4. Choose **Attach in Current Window** or **Attach in New Window** from the context menu
5. Click on **Open Folder**
6. Enter `/kohadevbox/koha`

## The right way ;)

1. Open VSCode
2. Hit the shortcut `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P`
3. Type __Dev Containers__ and choose the entry **Dev Containers: Attach to Running Container...**
4. Choose the `koha-koha-1` container
5. Hit `Ctrl/Cmd + O` and enter `/kohadevbox/koha`

## There's one more thing

The last thing you'll need to do is to install the perlnavigator extension into the container.
Just open the extensions tab and click **Install in Container koha/ko..**

# You're good to go

You can now configure perlnavigators settings to your liking and find all the definitions
you want! Formatting and Linting is already working using the .perlcriticrc and .perltidyrc files in
the project root.

Please tidy your code before submitting patches :D

PS: If you got the docker extension installed as well, you can get an overview of your running containers
in the docker tab and just attach from there.

Cheerio
