Koha Hackfest 2023: A Chilled-Out Recap

If you're a fan of Koha, you won't want to miss out on the Koha Hackfest. 
This year's event was a blast, with plenty of exciting developments to report.

A highlight was Mark of byWater's presentation about Aspen. It's always fascinating to see how this discovery system is evolving and improving over time.
And this year was no exception. The Aspen team has been hard at work, and the results are awesome.

Another exciting development is the new Vue-based ERM module. This is sure to give EBSCO and FOLIO a run for their money!
The demo was impressive, and we can't wait to see how this module continues to develop.

Another exciting development was the kick-off for a new npm package called create-koha-plugin.
This scaffolding tool for koha-plugins is sure to be a game-changer, helping developers speed up their plugin development in Koha in the future. 
I'm excited to see how this tool evolves and improves over time, and I have high hopes for its potential to streamline plugin development in Koha.

Of course, it's not all about work. The dinners at Marseille were a highlight of the event.
And if you find yourself in Marseille, be sure to try the Moulles Frittes. It's a local delicacy that's not to be missed.

Overall, the Koha Hackfest 2023 was a great success. It's exciting to see the Koha community come together to share ideas and collaborate on new developments. 
I can't wait to see what the future holds for Koha!
