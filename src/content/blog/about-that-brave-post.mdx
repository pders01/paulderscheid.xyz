# About that Brave post

So, first of all, everything I said about Brave obviously applies to Chromium in general.
I should've made that clear, but I wasn't thinking about it when I wrote that post.

## Zen won

We now have a new browser that does all that was outlined in that post and more with [Zen](https://zen-browser.app/).
Please check out that project and maybe even consider contributing if you can!

## My wishlist

-   [ ] What I still really miss is the folders within the sidebar.
    -   That even was supported, but for some reason that I am too lazy to search for, they removed it.
    -   Or maybe make the bookmarks view a little prettier.
        -   Here it would also be nice if I didn't have to Tab, then use the arrow keys and Enter.
-   [ ] I would really like my extension to be accessible from the omnibar (please don't make me use the mouse).
-   [ ] More shortcuts for everything, please!
-   [ ] Please give me a "close all below this line (regular tabs)" button that Arc had. Sure, `Cmd/Ctrl + w` is fine.
-   [ ] Vim mode, please.

## The project

-   I sometimes observe what's happening on Discord; check out:
    -   [Zen itself](https://zen-browser.app/about#get-help-heading)
    -   Zen Custom Themes (just search on the web)

I still think that Arc did a lot for exploring new browser UX, and I am thankful for that.
But you can't beat open source, sorry Arc.
