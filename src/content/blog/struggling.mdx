Life has been different the last couple of years. It all still feels like a fever dream we are
living in, though wide awake. AI, huh? I think it is a fascinating tool and almost a dream come
true. We are at a point where artificial general intelligence doesn’t feel out of reach anymore. I
always dreamed about stuff like that when I was a kid; what a privilege to witness it in its
infancy.

The rest of it doesn’t look that promising, however, and that’s while factoring in that AI looks
like one of the worst bubbles ever. Even with that in mind, it is still 10× more interesting than
the political theater we have to endure day to day.

We have witnessed the most sickening distortions of reality for selfish gain that I can remember
during my modest lifespan. It all fits too well. Maybe accelerated technological progression demands
a world that is malleable, in a proto-state again.

Forget old conventions. That world died in 2024. Keep what brought us where we are.
