            I'm a software engineer from Germany with a bachelor's degree in
            library sciences. I work at <a href="https://lmscloud.de"
                >LMSCloud</a
            >, an LMS support vendor, and as the index page shows, I work on and
            around an LMS called Koha.

            I love tech! Contributing to <a href="https://koha-community.org">Koha</a>
            really opened my eyes about my known unknowns. Challenging problems force
            you to learn and adapt to new context fast. The more you learn, the more
            humbling it gets.

            Perl is certainly no joke, you would be surprised what capabilities
            and depth this language and its associated communities provide!
            Check out <a href="https://mojolicious.org/">Mojolicious</a> for example
            or of course <a href="https://github.com/koha-community/koha">Koha</a>.
            And the Perl community is also very active, check out the
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@YAPCNA">conferences on YouTube</a>.

            I'm a passionate learner and always looking for new opportunities to
            grow. If I can help to make the world a little brighter while doing it,
            all the better.
